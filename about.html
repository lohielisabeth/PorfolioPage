            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Elisabeth Lohi, and I am 23 years old. I graduated from high school in 2021 and am currently in my second year of studying for a 
                Bachelor of Engineering degree in Information Technology. I have a vibrant personality, but I also highly value my personal time.<br><br>
            
                I enjoy playing video games and cooking. During high school, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Canada for a year. I have a light-hearted 
                approach to life and often take things with humor. Since starting school, I've become really passionate about coding and IT, despite not having 
                a background in programming.<br><br>
            
                I have experience working in customer service for a telecommunications company, as well as in various roles in the restaurant industry.<br><br>
