        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Elisabeth Lohi, and I am 24 years old. I graduated from high school in 2021 and am currently in my third year pursuing a 
            Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology. I am energetic and approachable, yet I also highly value my personal time.<br><br>

            I enjoy playing video games and cooking. During high school, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Canada for a year, which broadened my 
            perspective and strengthened my adaptability. I approach life with a sense of humor and positivity. Since starting my studies, I have developed a 
            strong passion for coding and IT, despite not having a prior programming background.<br><br>

            Professionally, I have experience in customer service at a telecommunications company, as well as in various roles within the restaurant industry.
